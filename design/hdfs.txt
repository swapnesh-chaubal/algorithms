Master Slave architecture
master is called name node, all others are data nodes
Name node: stores the names of files
Data Nodes: stores the data of the files

Creating a file in hdfs:
1. 3 actors: Hadoop client, Name node and data nodes
2. Client sends request to name node. Name node will check if the file exists, etc. It stores all that information about namespaces in memory, its called fsimage
3. Client will create a FSDataOutputStream and strart writing data
4. This stream buffers data (to size of data block)
5. After buffer is full, it asks for a block on hdfs
6. name node allocates block on data node and send the data node info back

Datanodes send heatbeats to the namenode to say that they're alive. Heartbeat also has block info
Typical block size of hdfs is 128MB

Replication

You can make hadoop rack aware
Name node initiates replication

HA
Refers to uptime of the system
Backup name node information, if NN failes, we can use this info to start a new NN.
There should always be a standy NN
NN maitains an editLog. Anychange it makes goes to the editlog
If we have editLog, we can reconstruct the in memory fsImage
QJM: Quorum Journal Manager, usually has 3 journal nodes
Configure NN to write the editLog to QJM
The standby NN keeps reading from QJM and keeps itself updated
DNs send heartbeat to both NN nodes

How to know when NN fails.
Zookeeper has a lock which is acquired by the active NN. The stand-by is always trying to get the lock. If the active NN fails, the secondary gets the lock

Secondary NN is different from standby name node.
Secondary name node saves the fsImage on disk and deletes the editLog before that.

We don't need secondary NN in HA config of hadoop because the standby name nodes does things that the secondary NN would do.
