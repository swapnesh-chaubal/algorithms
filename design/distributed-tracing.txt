Paper on Dapper, Google's distributed tracing software.
1. Google search is divided into thousands of machines, each doing its only thing like seraching ads, etc. Thus thousands of machines can be used to process 1 universal search query.
2. Hard to know which service is bottleneck
3. Ubiquitous deployment and continuous monitoring are important for Dapper
4. Tracing system should have a low overhead
5. Dapper is used along with other tools that look at the individual components
6. Samping is necessary for low overhead. For webrequests, even one out of 1000 was good enough.
