Write path:
When a row is added or modified in C*
1. It is first added to the commit log. This is an append only log so its really fast. The disk head doesn't have to move back and forth.
2. It is then added to a memtable, which is a table in memory.
3. When the memtable is full, it is flushed on to disk which is in an SSTable. An SSTable is also an append only table. The buffer size is configurable.

In case of a modify, the functionality doesn't change. It still does everything append only. However, there is compaction.
Compaction:
1. In case of compaction, C* does a merge sort of the values in case a primary key has more than 1 value and takes the latest value. It also removes deletes. and then deletes the old SSTables. It writes a new file with the merge sorted data.
Replication:
1. Hash the primary key using MD5, consistent hashing. Thus, when a record is added, it goes to the node in the token ring which matches the hash.
2. The replication number is the number of total nodes on which the record is present, thus if it's 3, the data is present on the current node plus 2 others.
3. Each node knows where domabstemio
